The ledge of the cliff cast a long shadow in the descending moon's crimson beams. Crimson were the color of the flames as well, fed by the logs piled up under the ledge. These logs - just as the figures<sup>0</sup> sitting around the fire - covered a good four thousand miles by the time they reached the edge of Taba el-Ibara, the desert spanning from the Sheral Mountains<sup>1</sup> to the gyep≈±<sup>2</sup> of the Merchant Duchies.<sup>3</sup> The logs rattled<sup>4</sup> this far on muleback, and the people seeking warmth had been carried by nags - most of them would indubitably pull a knife though if anyone else had called their mount that.<sup>5</sup>  Two-thirds of the pack animals bought in Erion have perished along the way, but none of it mattered now that the food supplies dwindled significantly as well, and here, in the shelter of the ledge, the night before the fateful day, the firewood has also finished its long journey. The temperature kept falling steadily after nightfall; the men, wrapped in their worn and patched up capes, scanned askance<sup>6</sup> at each other.

"The manase", explained a scarfaced character just now, who had a reputation in his younger years of being an accomplished assassin<sup>7</sup> in the Southland, "is a kinda creature like the manticore, but mayhap<sup>8</sup> nastier. There's<sup>9</sup> a "soldier of fortune"-type<sup>10</sup> bloke at home - you know, the sort that gets around a lot - that had a run-in with the beast. You shoulda seen 'is mug talkin' about it! It torn off his left arm, but his captain fared even worse!" He closed his eye while his left index finger traced the gash marred across his features, almost as if in a trance. "The manase had cubs at the time you see, and the captain gotten..."

"To Kraan!"<sup>N</sup>, snapped a voice sharply. "Your liver is perfidious<sup>N</sup> Hergolese<sup>N</sup> bastard, just as your double-tongued kind! The manase is a rare thing<sup>N</sup>, so rare in fact that run-of-the-mill mercenaries wouldn't just bump into it! And when ill fortune does put one in their way, they won't get out of it as easily as your fellow countryman<sup>N</sup>! That brute will petrify you, and if it doesn't tear you apart, it's only to preserve your body for the priests of Themes, whom<sup>N</sup> it serves, to use it for their foul rituals, just as they do it with blood, viscera, and bones!
