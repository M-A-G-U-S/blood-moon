The ledge of the cliff cast a long shadow in the descending moon's crimson beams. Crimson were the color of the flames as well, fed by the logs piled up under the ledge. These logs - just as the figures<sup>0</sup> sitting around the fire - covered a good four thousand miles by the time they reached the edge of Taba el-Ibara, the desert spanning from the Sheral Mountains<sup>1</sup> to the gyepű<sup>2</sup> of the Merchant Duchies.<sup>3</sup> The logs rattled<sup>4</sup> this far on muleback, and the people seeking warmth had been carried by nags - most of them would indubitably pull a knife though if anyone else had called their mount that.<sup>5</sup>  Two-thirds of the pack animals bought in Erion have perished along the way, but none of it mattered now that the food supplies dwindled significantly as well, and here, in the shelter of the ledge, the night before the fateful day, the firewood has also finished its long journey. The temperature kept falling steadily after nightfall; the men, wrapped in their worn and patched up capes, scanned askance<sup>6</sup> at each other.

"The manase", explained a scarfaced character just now, who had a reputation in his younger years of being an accomplished assassin<sup>7</sup> in the Southland, "is a kinda creature like the manticore, but mayhap<sup>8</sup> nastier. There's<sup>9</sup> a "soldier of fortune"-type<sup>10</sup> bloke at home - you know, the sort that gets around a lot - that had a run-in with the beast. You shoulda seen 'is mug talkin' about it! It torn off his left arm, but his captain fared even worse!" He closed his eye while his left index finger traced the gash marred across his features, almost as if in a trance. "The manase had cubs at the time you see, and the captain gotten..."

your only saviour is my magic
if you value your skin
get out of alive from this endeavor


"To Kraan!"<sup>N</sup>, snapped a voice sharply. "Your liver is perfidious<sup>N</sup> Hergolese<sup>N</sup> bastard, just as your double-tongued kind!

[0] I believe "_figure_" is used as a synonym for "_person_"; if not, probably "_people_" or "_individuals_" (or even "_fellows_") would've been better. Although if "_figure_" can indeed be used, it may be the best, because in my mind it conjures up an image of their shadows dancing behind them by the flames of the campfire.

[1] Or "_Sheral mountain_"?

[2] "_palisades_" would have probably been more suitable, but I like the sound of "_gyepű_" (but of course, I'm biased). See [1](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Gyep%C5%B1/3540433954), [2](https://books.google.com/books?id=SgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT527&lpg=PT527&dq=indago+frontier&source=bl&ots=9J-aL1wcUA&sig=ACfU3U048cNwIbWmx09v2spF0nIxPNHVVQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijx8WW7I7nAhU4HzQIHQ5MAuoQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=indago&f=false), [3](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyep%C5%B1).

[3] "_Taba el-Ibara peremére, a Sheral hegységtöl a Kereskedö Hercegségek gyepéiig húzódó sivatag mélyébe értek._" Talan mar a kelletenel tobbszor olvastam el ezt a mondatot, de hogy ertek a melyere, ha a peremen voltak?

[4] Or "_clattered_"?

[5] So what is the right tense? The first clause is in past simple, and the second is in past perfect (in the passive voice). This footnote is going to be a recurring theme...

[6] Trying to convey the meaning of the Hungarian adverb "sandán", which means "with suspicion and/or ill intent", and "[askance](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNRCZncAt-wxG7w8PXJ1KnJb_5IWRQ%3A1579463340975&ei=rLIkXoOQO9jP0PEPiI-Z0Ao&q=sideways+meaning&oq=sideways+meaning&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i20i263i70i249j0l9.1651.2384..2531...0.2..0.87.620.8....2..0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i67j0i131j0i20i263.GWH3po6O6po&ved=0ahUKEwiDlv-6t5DnAhXYJzQIHYhHBqoQ4dUDCAs&uact=5#dobs=askance)" seemed to fit the bill, especially given the context of the Hungarian original.

[7] "_jónevű_" can be translated in may ways, such as reputable, respected, successful, respectable, prestigious, accomplished, etc. but chose "_accomplished_" because the Hergolese is obviously not a good guy, and this only establishes that he is well-trained, skillful, and perhaps successful (revealing nothing about his character).

[8] "_Possibly_" would've been the best fit, but "_mayhap_" means the same (hopefully), and it fits the character better.

[9] That is, "_there was_", but the way he talks the form chosen may be better, even with the loss of information.

[10] What is the proper grammar here?
}}}
[N] The name of the empire is "_Krán_", which is pronounced similar to "_Kraan_", and the exclamation here is "_Kránra_" (an expletive) that literally means to "_To Kraan_".

[N] No clue how to translate this. The expression "_hazug a májad_" seems to be specific to the world of Ynev, and I never came across it elsewhere in Hungarian. Online searches always result in the Hungarian book as well.

[N] Making up geographical adjectives as I go. (Is this the right way to say it?) The city's name is Hergol, and "_Hergolean_" rhymes with "_herculean_" which (to me at least) has positive connotations. but Hergol is anything but, hence the word "_Hergolese_".
