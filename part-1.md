PART ONE
========

The cliff cast a long shadow in the descending moon's crimson beams. Crimson were the color of the flames as well, fed by the logs piled up under the ledge. These logs - just as the figures<sup>0</sup> sitting around the fire - covered a good four thousand miles by the time they reached the edge of Taba el-Ibara, the desert spanning from the Sheral Mountains<sup>1</sup> to the gyepű<sup>2</sup> of the Merchant Duchies.<sup>3</sup> The logs rattled<sup>4</sup> this far on muleback, and the people seeking warmth had been carried by nags - although most of them would indubitably pull a knife if anyone else had called their mount that.<sup>5</sup>  Two-thirds of the pack animals bought in Erion have perished along the way, but none of it mattered now that the food supplies dwindled significantly as well, and here, in the shelter of the ledge, the night before the fateful day, the firewood has also finished its long journey. The temperature kept falling steadily after nightfall; the men, wrapped in their worn and patched up capes, scanned askance<sup>6</sup> at each other.

"The manase", explained a scar-faced character just now, who had a reputation in his younger years of being an accomplished assassin<sup>7</sup> in the Southland, "is a kinda creature like the manticore, but mayhap<sup>8</sup> nastier. There's<sup>9</sup> a "soldier of fortune"-type<sup>10</sup> bloke at home - you know, the sort that gets around a lot - that had a run-in with the beast. You shoulda seen 'is mug talkin' about it! It torn off his left arm, but his captain fared even worse!" He closed his eye while his left index finger traced the gash marred across his features, almost as if in a trance. "The manase had cubs at the time you see, and the captain gotten..."

"To Kraan!"<sup>11</sup>, a voice snapped sharply. "Your liver is perfidious<sup>12</sup> you Hergolese<sup>13</sup> bastard, just as your double-tongued kind! The manase is a rare thing<sup>14</sup> - so rare in fact that run-of-the-mill mercenaries wouldn't just bump into it! And when ill fortune does put one in their way, they won't get out of it as easily as your fellow countryman<sup>15</sup> did! That brute will petrify you, and if it doesn't tear you apart, it's only to preserve your body for Themes' priests, whom<sup>16</sup> it serves, to use it for their foul rituals, just as they do it with blood, viscera, and bones!" The gaunt warlock leaned forward, flashing his broken teeth. "If you hope to succeed by trying to take it by surprise<sup>17</sup> then let me tell you something: you have no more chance than these other good-for-nothing nobodies!", gesturing in the direction of the armed men huddled up around the fire. "If you value your skin and would like to get out of this little endeavor alive, then your only option is to trust the power of my sorcery, etch this in your minds! A single one of my words can..."

A raggedy Arel priest<sup>18</sup> spat out pointedly<sup>19</sup> upon hearing this. The warlock spun towards him, the slightly open slit of his lips resembling a snake just about to attack, murmuring a curse perhaps - as suspected by the rest of the company at least - because in the next instant the moon's crimson glow faded, as if a candle had been snuffed out. Arel's servant snatched out his dagger without hesitation and he would have certainly thrown it into the Abassissene<sup>20</sup> mongrel if the ones sitting next to him didn't catch his arm.

"Wait!", hissed someone. "Wait! It wasn't a spell! Amhe Ramun will stoke the Blue Flames ere long!"

Those present waited in rapt silence, all eyes fixed on the eastern horizon, where the second celestial companion of the world emerged in a radiant aquamarine halo. Its face dispersed the Midnight<sup>21</sup> gloom at once, covering the singing sand in silver sheen<sup>23</sup>.

"One day", whispered the Arel-priest with a chilling smile while lowering the dagger, "Those living like rats will die like rats. One day..."

"Quiet!", cut in the one with the scarred face. "Someone's coming!"

A dozen bolted to their feet, scurried for their weapons with muffled gasps - only to lower them moments later with lips twitching into grins<sup>25</sup>.

"It's the bard", said a stocky djad<sup>26</sup>. "The halfwit."

"It's him alright", the warlock said with a nod. "Where could've he been this long?"

"He was singin' maybe", remarked the assassin.

"We would've heard that though. But then, why would singin' be the thing he does the same as everyone else with his numskull?" The short djad watched him approach with amusement.

"Bard, c'mere! Sit wit' us!" The halfwit got to the edge of the campfire's halo. There he sat on his heels, and started studying the footprints completely absorbed.

"Rest assured,", tossed the words the so far silent tracker, "every single one of those are ours; the horses don't dare coming this close, and you'll struggle to find another living creature around here... All made a run for it a long time ago, lest they be in the vicinity of the temple<sup>27</sup>."

The bard was still crouching, only his head was tilted to one side<sup>28</sup> as if eavesdropping.

"Are you deaf?", barked the tracker. He couldn't stand this guy; too tall and too broad-shouldered for his taste. On the rare occasions he did open his mouth, he talked with a maddening Northern accent. What's more, he dressed in fine clothes and rode a majestic horse like one of those toffs. The tracker, being a practical man, couldn't wrap his head around why the grand vizier of El Hamed would send along a comedian<sup>29</sup> against the priests of Themes... Truth be told, they all had pondered at one point whether to get rid of him, for better or worse, but the tales about the magical powers of the bards put them on guard. "Or maybe you don't trust my skills you smartass?"

"Leave him alone!", guffawed the djad. "Can't'cha see he's teasing you?"

Slowly, the dimwit straightened up, stepped closer to the huddled up group, and falteringly looked for a place among them. He was made handsome, yet seemingly the gods, who were responsible for his even features, gray eyes, and proud posture<sup>30</sup>, deemed him undeserving of these gifts. A nerve on his left cheek - perhaps since childhood - would spasmodically tense up or start to twitch now and then. Oftentimes his lips would curl up in a strange, lopsided smile, and at such occasions, without a doubt in his attempts to preserve dignity, even his motions grew hesitant. He would waver now and again but it appeared that only years of experience spent in great halls keeps saving him from falling<sup>31</sup> - that he always managed to stay on his feet was even more vexing for the observer. Never speaking about his past, the bard's affliction remained a popular topic of speculation<sup>32</sup>; was it a horse riding accident,a the hired thugs of a jealous dame, or some sort of poison that is to blame for his misfortune? In addition to taking exertions lying down, not ever did he pick a fight, albeit some of the crude jokes would justify drawing blood even<sup>33</sup>. Every so often he moved aside<sup>34</sup> - belike<sup>35</sup> to beseech<sup>36</sup>his god, to do penance for one of his atrocious acts, or, to tune his eight-string lyre. No one ever saw him play.

The atmosphere under the ledge was peaceful this night: the booze-fuelled camaraderie was extended to the halfwit as well. The marauders were patting his back, kept shoving a skin<sup>N</sup> full of scraping<sup>N</sup> Gro-Ugonic pálinka<sup>N</sup> under his nose; in other words, he was being pampered in every way they knew possible.

"The time's coming...", whispered the scar-faced assassin transcendently. He leaned forward, spat a gulp of spirit into the flames that roared up instantly, angry and high, but died down just as fast. He grabbed the musician standing up, and dragged him atop the hill where the temple of Themes' worshippers, a place cursed a thousand times over, could be seen in full view.

"Hear me bard: by this time tomorrow we will be heading back from that hellish place... and we are going to be rich, very rich! Do you know what we'll do once we are back to Erion? Care to guess? Let me tell ya: we rent out an entire whorehouse! I bet that the Daughter of Lotus will love your smooth, pretty kisser!

The grey-eyed man grinned, perplexed, causing that certain nerve twitch once on his left cheek. The people around the fire howled, even though they couldn't possibly hear any of it.

"We were talking about the manase", continued the killer in a confidential tone. "Some say it flies like a bird, others that it survives underwater, but it is not similar to a lion, but more akin to an octopus... What do you think, eh?"

"Manase..." - echoed the bard, his resonant<sup>N</sup> voice rich with peculiar<sup>N</sup> timbres.<sup>N</sup>

Scar-face's nape began to prickle but the feeling has passed before it truly started to annoy him.

"Once, a long time ago, learned a song of demure virgins", he confessed with downcast eyes, "and about the, this..."

The Hergolese gave up with a wave of his hand. The toff surely had his own brandy reserves, otherwise he wouldn't mistake the manase with a unicorn.

"Git to rest!", he burst out in a raw growl. "I's gonna be a hard day tomorrow, and I ain't no baby-sitter to get your share!" The bard turned around without a word, started off back to the fire with wobbly steps. The assassin's eyes narrowed as they followed him go. Bah, magic powers! Dangerous, yeah right!<sup>N</sup> If that... He was still fuming when he finally - as the last one in the party - fell asleep.

The silver sheen of the blue moon<sup>N</sup> was still brilliant, but already well towards the western horizon, dawn's faint glow getting brighter across when the bard opened his eyes. Shrouded in a dark cloak, he rose like an apparition<sup>N</sup>, his soundless steps would have done credit even to a manhunter. Not once did he stagger as he left behind the fire's weakly smouldering remains. The sleepers in his path shuddered lightly, the animals tethered in a semi-circle on the other hand remained calm as if they knew: there is nothing to fear. The man ducked under the stretched-out ropes fastened hastily at dusk, and stepped to an enormous white stallion whose back he covered with a spare cape - while disregarding the wisecracks - when starting camp the night before. The horse raised its head seeing him, then, as an eerie, silent welcome, nodded once, twice, three times. The bard's right moved with hypnotic slowness, then it rested on the neck of the steed. The blue moon painted silver streaks on its hair, beneath muscles bulged, as impressive as that of the the unicorns in the Northern woodlands. Its dark eyes sparkled, like minute replicas of the drape of stars enveloping Ynev. The light breeze caught the bard's cape, ruffled the horse's mane: these two were standing there in the fine, drizzling dust as the living symbols of perpetual cosmic duality. The man tilted his head, smiling, and this smile wasn't haunted by even a shadow of insecurity, let alone of weakness.<sup>N</sup> Daybreak was approaching, but the wind didn't drop. It became stronger yet; black, white...

"Almost over", whispered the bard into the stallion's ears, stroking it lovingly as one only would a spouse or a mistress. "Soon!"

The sun grudgingly clambered higher in the sky: Themes opened their<sup>N</sup> scorching eyes unto the desert, the air rapidly heating up and starting to shimmer in the path of their gaze. Wanton wind was swirling among the rock formations, its buzz neither able to drown out the stirring of the living nor the hum of the stones - that strange sound known to man since prehistoric times, gathered by simple souls to be a sort of hymn.

The shadows were still pointing long westward when the temple's massive, double gates opened, and from the darkness, it was the sungod's high priest emerged to properly greet his steadily rising master. He took three steps with a pious expression on his ageless, bronze face, then cast off his

Kortalan, bronzszínű arcán ájtatos kifejezéssel három lépést tett elöre, majd ledobta aranyszálakkal átszött köntösét, s két karját széttárva mély, torokhangú kántálásba kezdett. Ősi dallam volt ez, meglehet, ösibb még a kövek énekénél is, ösibb mindannál, amit e föld népei a magukénak ismertek. A generációkon át dúló háborúk alatt - ezek változtatták pusztasággá e hajdan zöldellö vidéket - e hangra más síkok teremtményei bukkantak fel, hogy gyözelemre segítsék Themes fiainak ügyét. A mezök azóta sivataggá változtak, ama nevezetes lények pedig kihaltak, netán elköltöztek; már csak a biztonságos távolban húzódó karavánutakat járó dzsadok - az ifjabb, feltörekvö emberfaj képviselöi - rémisztgetik egymást a vérfagyasztó kántálás hallatán, tudván tudva, hogy ott, ahonnét száll, változatlanul emberáldozatok zajlanak... A föpap kántált, ám nem volt szerencséje: a napból válasz gyanánt csupán nyílvesszök érkeztek dühödt surrogással, mellét, nyakát ütötték át, a legutolsó tágra nyílt szájába csapódott, s agyába hatolva tüstént megölte. Hanyatt zuhant a homokba, szeme vakon meredt a reggeli égboltra: egyetlen jel sem árulta el, de útban volt már istenéhez. A kalandorok szedett-vedett csapata a kapuhoz tódult.
- Tüzet! - förmedt a boszorkánymesterre a hergoli, aki a falhoz lapulva kotorászott a zsákjában. Egykettöre elökerültek, az abasziszi intésére fellobbantak a fáklyák, tompán villantak a hüvelyükböl kiröppenö kardok.
