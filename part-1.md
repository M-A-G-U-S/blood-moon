PART ONE
========

The ledge of the cliff cast a long shadow in the descending moon's crimson beams. Crimson were the color of the flames as well, fed by the logs piled up under the ledge. These logs - just as the figures<sup>0</sup> sitting around the fire - covered a good four thousand miles by the time they reached the edge of Taba el-Ibara, the desert spanning from the Sheral Mountains<sup>1</sup> to the gyep≈±<sup>2</sup> of the Merchant Duchies.<sup>3</sup> The logs rattled<sup>4</sup> this far on muleback, and the people seeking warmth had been carried by nags - most of them would indubitably pull a knife though if anyone else had called their mount that.<sup>5</sup>  Two-thirds of the pack animals bought in Erion have perished along the way, but none of it mattered now that the food supplies dwindled significantly as well, and here, in the shelter of the ledge, the night before the fateful day, the firewood has also finished its long journey. The temperature kept falling steadily after nightfall; the men, wrapped in their worn and patched up capes, scanned askance<sup>6</sup> at each other.

"The manase", explained a scar-faced character just now, who had a reputation in his younger years of being an accomplished assassin<sup>7</sup> in the Southland, "is a kinda creature like the manticore, but mayhap<sup>8</sup> nastier. There's<sup>9</sup> a "soldier of fortune"-type<sup>10</sup> bloke at home - you know, the sort that gets around a lot - that had a run-in with the beast. You shoulda seen 'is mug talkin' about it! It torn off his left arm, but his captain fared even worse!" He closed his eye while his left index finger traced the gash marred across his features, almost as if in a trance. "The manase had cubs at the time you see, and the captain gotten..."

"To Kraan!"<sup>11</sup>, snapped a voice sharply. "Your liver is perfidious<sup>12</sup> Hergolese<sup>13</sup> bastard, just as your double-tongued kind! The manase is a rare thing<sup>14</sup>, so rare in fact that run-of-the-mill mercenaries wouldn't just bump into it! And when ill fortune does put one in their way, they won't get out of it as easily as your fellow countryman<sup>15</sup>! That brute will petrify you, and if it doesn't tear you apart, it's only to preserve your body for the priests of Themes, whom<sup>16</sup> it serves, to use it for their foul rituals, just as they do it with blood, viscera, and bones!" The gaunt warlock leaned forward, flashing his broken teeth. "If you hope to succeed by trying to take it by surprise<sup>17</sup> then let me tell you something: you have no more chance than these other good-for-nothing nobodies!", gesturing in the direction of the armed men huddled up around the fire. "If you value your skin, and would like to get out of this little endeavor alive then your only option is to trust the power of my sorcery, etch this in your minds! A single one of my words can..."

A raggedy Arel-priest<sup>18</sup> spat out pointedly<sup>19</sup> upon hearing this. The warlock spun towards him, the slightly open slit of his lips resembling a snake just about to attack, murmuring a curse perhaps - suspected the rest of the company at least -, because in the next instant the moon's crimson glow faded off, just as quickly as snuffing out a candle. Arel's servant snatched out his dagger without hesitation, and he would have certainly thrown it into the Abassissene<sup>20</sup> mongrel, if the ones sitting next to him didn't catch his arm.

"Wait!", hissed someone. "Wait! It wasn't a spell! Amhe Ramun will stoke the Blue Flames ere long!"

Those present waited in rapt silence, all eyes fixed on the eastern horizon, where the second celestial companion of this world emerged in a radiant aquamarine halo. Its face dispersed the Midnight<sup>N</sup> gloom at once, covering the quicksand<sup>N</sup> in silver sheen<sup>N</sup>.

"One day", whispered the Arel-priest with a chilling smile, while lowering the dagger, "Those living like rats will die like rats. One day..."

"Shut up!"<sup>N</sup>, cut in the one with the scarred face. "Someone's coming!"

A dozen bolted to their feet, scurried for their weapons with muffled gasps - only to lower them moments later with lips twitching into grins<sup>N</sup>.

"It's the bard", said a stocky dzsad<sup>N</sup>. "The halfwit."

"It's him alright", the warlock said with a nod. "Where could he have been this long?"

"He was singin' maybe", remarked the assassin.

"We would've heard that though. But then, why would singin' be the thing he does the same as everyone else with his numskull?" The compactly built dzsad watched him approach, amused.

"Bard, c'mere! Sit with us!" The halfwit got to the edge of the campfire's halo. There he sat on his heels, and started studying the footprints completely absorbed.

"Rest assured,", tossed the words the so far silent tracker, "every single one of those are ours; the horses don't dare coming this close, and you'll struggle to find any other living creature around here... All of them made a run for it a long time ago, lest they be in the vicinity of the temple<sup>N</sup>."

The bard was still crouching, only his head was tilted to one side<sup>N</sup> as if eavesdropping.

"Are you deaf?", barked the tracker. He couldn't stand this guy. Too tall, and too broad-shouldered for his taste; on the rare occasions he did open his mouth, he talked with a maddening northern accent. What's more, he dressed in fine clothes, and rode a majestic horse like one of those toffs. The tracker, being a practical man, couldn't wrap his head around why El Hamed's grand vizier would send along a comedian<sup>N</sup> against the priest of Themes...
