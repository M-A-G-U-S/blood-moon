[0] I believe "_figure_" is used as a synonym for "_person_"; if not, probably "_people_" or "_individuals_" (or even "_fellows_") would've been better. Although if "_figure_" can indeed be used, it may be the best, because in my mind it conjures up an image of their shadows dancing behind them by the flames of the campfire.

[1] Or "_Sheral mountain_"?

[2] "_palisades_" would have probably been more suitable, but I like the sound of "_gyepű_" (but of course, I'm biased). See [1](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Gyep%C5%B1/3540433954), [2](https://books.google.com/books?id=SgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT527&lpg=PT527&dq=indago+frontier&source=bl&ots=9J-aL1wcUA&sig=ACfU3U048cNwIbWmx09v2spF0nIxPNHVVQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijx8WW7I7nAhU4HzQIHQ5MAuoQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=indago&f=false), [3](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyep%C5%B1).

[3] "_Taba el-Ibara peremére, a Sheral hegységtöl a Kereskedö Hercegségek gyepéiig húzódó sivatag mélyébe értek._" Talan mar a kelletenel tobbszor olvastam el ezt a mondatot, de hogy ertek a melyere, ha a peremen voltak?

[4] Or "_clattered_"?

[5] So what is the right tense? The first clause is in past simple, and the second is in past perfect (in the passive voice). This footnote is going to be a recurring theme...

[6] Trying to convey the meaning of the Hungarian adverb "sandán", which means "with suspicion and/or ill intent", and "[askance](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNRCZncAt-wxG7w8PXJ1KnJb_5IWRQ%3A1579463340975&ei=rLIkXoOQO9jP0PEPiI-Z0Ao&q=sideways+meaning&oq=sideways+meaning&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i20i263i70i249j0l9.1651.2384..2531...0.2..0.87.620.8....2..0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i67j0i131j0i20i263.GWH3po6O6po&ved=0ahUKEwiDlv-6t5DnAhXYJzQIHYhHBqoQ4dUDCAs&uact=5#dobs=askance)" seemed to fit the bill, especially given the context of the Hungarian original.

[7] "_jónevű_" can be translated in may ways, such as reputable, respected, successful, respectable, prestigious, accomplished, etc. but chose "_accomplished_" because the Hergolese is obviously not a good guy, and this only establishes that he is well-trained, skillful, and perhaps successful (revealing nothing about his character).

[8] "_Possibly_" would've been the best fit, but "_mayhap_" means the same (hopefully), and it fits the character better.

[9] That is, "_there was_", but the way he talks the form chosen may be better, even with the loss of information.

[10] What is the proper grammar here?

[11] The name of the empire is "_Krán_", which is pronounced similar to "_Kraan_", and the exclamation here is "_Kránra_" (an expletive) that literally means to "_To Kraan_".

[12] No clue how to translate this. The expression "_hazug a májad_" seems to be specific to the world of Ynev, and I never came across it elsewhere in Hungarian. Online searches always result in the Hungarian book as well.  
**Update**: As it turns out, this is a nod towards the Hungarian translation of Shakespeare's Hamlet by János Arany:

> ```text
> Fricskázza orrom’? s mondja, hogy hazug
> A májam, a tüdöm? Ki teszi meg? Hah!
> ```
https://mek.oszk.hu/04500/04592/html/magyar.htm

The corresponding English lines:

> ```text
> Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
> As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
> Ha!
> ```

[13] Making up geographical adjectives as I go. (Is this the right way to say it?) The city's name is Hergol, and "_Hergolean_" rhymes with "_herculean_" which (to me at least) has positive connotations. but Hergol is anything but, hence the word "_Hergolese_".

[14] Used "_brute_" here initially, because I didn't want to write "_creature_" again, but settled on "_thing_" in the end, as it would probably come up in a heated conversation more organically. As a sidenote, I love the Hungarian word in the original, "_jószág_", because it just as perfectly describes a mythical creature as a mere animal. I think, the word "_szerzet_" would have been another good fit here.

[15] Another word would've been "_compatriot_", but I haven't seen it used much.

[16] After some research, this seems to be the correct way to say "_akiket szolgál_", but will keep an eye out.

[17] "_orvtámadás_" means "_stealth attack_" with negative connotations, and it is the perfect phrase to use for an assassin, but "_taking it by surprise_" seemed a better choice.

[18] Translated "_rongyos_" as raggedy, but what about "_An Arel priest, clothes in tatters,_".

[19] This almost sounds like a pun, but "_pointedly_" works both literally and figuratively. From the dictionary:
> in a direct and unambiguous way, often indicating criticism or displeasure.

[20] The Hungarian name of the place is "_Abaszisz_" so probably the closest English equivalent would be "_Abassiss_", and chose "_Abassissene_" as its [demonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonym). What would be a more suitable one?

[21] Capitalized "_midnight_" because the original was too. Couldn't find the right equivalent for archaic "_Éjközép_", and the closest in meaning (and length) was "_midnight_", but it isn't even close in awesomeness.

[22] "_sívóhomok_" is the archaic synonym for "_futóhomok_", which is "_quicksand_" in English. Again, couldn't find another version for it, but learned that ["quick" in "_quicksand_" supposed to mean "alive"](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/62115/why-is-quicksand-named-so-if-you-get-sucked-in-so-slowly). Just adding the meaning of ["sívó"](https://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/Lexikonok-a-magyar-nyelv-ertelmezo-szotara-1BE8B/s-4893A/sivo-49758/) as well.

[23] "_beezüstözni_" literally means "_to coat with silver_", but that wouldn't exactly work here, and couldn't come up with anything better at the moment.

[24] "_Silence!_" would be more accurate here, but I believe "_Shut up!_" is more fitting to the character.

[25] "_vigyorra ránduló ajakkal_" would best be translated with "_lips curling into grins_", but "_rándul_" means to "_twitch_", and I like that image of them nervously trying to smile (with their nerves are kind of shot anyway).

[26] This should probably be "_djad_", but I don't like it written like that.

[27] This is probably grammatically incorrect.

[28] "Cocked" may be better.

[29] Or "_joker_" perhaps?

[30] Couldn't find a better word for "_fejtartás_".

[31] There's something fishy about the tenses here, but can't figure out what would be best.

[32] "_Conjecture_" was here originally, but it sounded more academic, and the topic is also about common folks.

[33] Again, something with the tenses.

[34] Originally wrote "_moved away to seek privacy_" to translate "_félrevonult_", but it seemed to be belaboring the point. Was also thinking about "_sequestered himself_" but for me it appears to be on another level.

[35] Archaic form of "_perhaps_" and "_maybe_". "_Perchance_" was another candidate, but there have been to many times I couldn't deliver a good equivalent of the antique Hungarian word.

[36] After finding the super old-fashioned "_belike_", "_pray_" sounded too common. The entire sentence will probably sound like [Joey's "aorta pump" speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcM4zWiikKQ). Also, with the beginning of the sentence being so lofty, the contrast of the last clause really delivers.

[N] "_Tömlő_" in this context means "_wineskin_", but "_skin_" can also be used to make it alcoholic drink-agnostic.

[N] Decided to use a non-standard demonym for Gro-Ugon, which is the same as the name of the place.

[N] "_Pálinka_" is a type of Hungarian fruit brandy with its own specific distillation process. Could've used "_brandy_", but this way it's more exotic, and I like that it refers to the Hungarian origins of the novel. Also, pálinka is not even close to brandy or vodka; when you try one, you'll know. (Was also thinking about using the phrase "_fence-ripper_", "_kerítésszaggató_" in Hungarian, but decided to put it off until the next time.)

[N] Initially put "_orotund_", not "_sonorous_", because there is a character in this world called Sonor, but it has negative connotations, but the latter sounds cooler. In the end, abandoned both of them as the Hungarian original didn't only mentioned that his voice was rich (see next note), no mentions of pitch or other qualities.

[N] Based on word meanings, "_eldritch_" or "_uncanny_" would have been the best fit but they are not neutral but more negative (or is this just me?).

[N] This was the hardest to translate so far because the original is beautifully written, shrouds the character in mystery without giving too much away.
