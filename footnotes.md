[0] I believe "_figure_" is used as a synonym for "_person_"; if not, probably "_people_" or "_individuals_" (or even "_fellows_") would've been better. Although if "_figure_" can indeed be used, it may be the best, because in my mind it conjures up an image of their shadows dancing behind them by the flames of the campfire.

[1] Or "_Sheral mountain_"?

[2] "_palisades_" would have probably been more suitable, but I like the sound of "_gyepű_" (but of course, I'm biased). See [1](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Gyep%C5%B1/3540433954), [2](https://books.google.com/books?id=SgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT527&lpg=PT527&dq=indago+frontier&source=bl&ots=9J-aL1wcUA&sig=ACfU3U048cNwIbWmx09v2spF0nIxPNHVVQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijx8WW7I7nAhU4HzQIHQ5MAuoQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=indago&f=false), [3](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyep%C5%B1).

[3] "_Taba el-Ibara peremére, a Sheral hegységtöl a Kereskedö Hercegségek gyepéiig húzódó sivatag mélyébe értek._" Talan mar a kelletenel tobbszor olvastam el ezt a mondatot, de hogy ertek a melyere, ha a peremen voltak?

[4] Or "_clattered_"?

[5] So what is the right tense? The first clause is in past simple, and the second is in past perfect (in the passive voice). This footnote is going to be a recurring theme...

[6] Trying to convey the meaning of the Hungarian adverb "sandán", which means "with suspicion and/or ill intent", and "[askance](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNRCZncAt-wxG7w8PXJ1KnJb_5IWRQ%3A1579463340975&ei=rLIkXoOQO9jP0PEPiI-Z0Ao&q=sideways+meaning&oq=sideways+meaning&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i20i263i70i249j0l9.1651.2384..2531...0.2..0.87.620.8....2..0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i67j0i131j0i20i263.GWH3po6O6po&ved=0ahUKEwiDlv-6t5DnAhXYJzQIHYhHBqoQ4dUDCAs&uact=5#dobs=askance)" seemed to fit the bill, especially given the context of the Hungarian original.

[7] "_jónevű_" can be translated in may ways, such as reputable, respected, successful, respectable, prestigious, accomplished, etc. but chose "_accomplished_" because the Hergolese is obviously not a good guy, and this only establishes that he is well-trained, skillful, and perhaps successful (revealing nothing about his character).

[8] "_Possibly_" would've been the best fit, but "_mayhap_" means the same (hopefully), and it fits the character better.

[9] That is, "_there was_", but the way he talks the form chosen may be better, even with the loss of information.

[10] What is the proper grammar here?

[11] The name of the empire is "_Krán_", which is pronounced similar to "_Kraan_", and the exclamation here is "_Kránra_" (an expletive) that literally means to "_To Kraan_".

[12] No clue how to translate this. The expression "_hazug a májad_" seems to be specific to the world of Ynev, and I never came across it elsewhere in Hungarian. Online searches always result in the Hungarian book as well.  
**Update**: As it turns out, this is a nod towards the Hungarian translation of Shakespeare's Hamlet by János Arany:

> ```text
> Fricskázza orrom’? s mondja, hogy hazug
> A májam, a tüdöm? Ki teszi meg? Hah!
> ```
https://mek.oszk.hu/04500/04592/html/magyar.htm

The corresponding English lines:

> ```text
> Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
> As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
> Ha!
> ```

[13] Making up geographical adjectives as I go. (Is this the right way to say it?) The city's name is Hergol, and "_Hergolean_" rhymes with "_herculean_" which (to me at least) has positive connotations. but Hergol is anything but, hence the word "_Hergolese_".

[14] Used "_brute_" here initially, because I didn't want to write "_creature_" again, but settled on "_thing_" in the end, as it would probably come up in a heated conversation more organically. As a sidenote, I love the Hungarian word in the original, "_jószág_", because it just as perfectly describes a mythical creature as a mere animal. I think, the word "_szerzet_" would have been another good fit here.

[15] Another word would've been "_compatriot_", but I haven't seen it used much.

[16] After some research, this seems to be the correct way to say "_akiket szolgál_", but will keep an eye out.

[17] "_orvtámadás_" means "_stealth attack_" with negative connotations, and it is the perfect phrase to use for an assassin, but "_taking it by surprise_" seemed a better choice.

[18] Translated "_rongyos_" as raggedy, but what about "_An Arel priest, clothes in tatters,_".

[19] This almost sounds like a pun, but "_pointedly_" works both literally and figuratively. From the dictionary:
> in a direct and unambiguous way, often indicating criticism or displeasure.

[20] The Hungarian name of the place is "_Abaszisz_" so probably the closest English equivalent would be "_Abassiss_", and chose "_Abassissene_" as its [demonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonym). What would be a more suitable one?
